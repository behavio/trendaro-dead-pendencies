# trendaro-dead-pendencies
A monorepo with all obscure packages surrounding the `matl-is-core`.

GitHub's `Releases` host packages for `pip install`.

As many of the packages are depending on eg `django-chamber`, update to one
usually means releasing all, otherwise pip calls out dependency mismatch.
